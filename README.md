# Features

3. Gun: I Add A 3D Gun To Shoot The Enemy Or We Can Say The Zombie, I Took The 3D Model From sketchfab.com

5. Enemy Demage: When Player Shoot Enemy Take Demage
6. Fall Demage: I Had NO Idea How To Manage The Fall Demage But I Did It (Explain It Later)
7. Dead When Fall Out OF The Land: So My Gmae have The Island Where Player Lie But If Player Fall Out Of The Land Player will Die : if player.y = -30 -> dead()
8. Dead UI: If player Die HE/She Needs A Respawn Button and UI To Know Player Is Dead
